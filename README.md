## Welcome to My Repository!

This repository contains a collection of code that I have written for some economics experiments using oTree. 

## Experiment: Order Of Difficulty

The **OrderOfDifficulty** experiment investigates how the order of question difficulty influences an individual's performance. Additionally, we delve into the underlying mechanisms of this effect, which include:
- **Fatigue**
- **Confidence**
- **Learning**

### Current Status

As of now, we have successfully collected data from 200 participants via Prolific.
