## Welcome to My Repository!

This repository contains a collection of code that I have written for some economics experiments using oTree. 

## Experiment: Order Of Difficulty

The **"OrderOfDifficulty"** experiment investigates how the order of task difficulty influences an individual's performance. Additionally, we delve into the underlying mechanisms of this effect, which include:
- Fatigue
- Confidence

### Progress
- experiment design and pre-registration ✔

- online experiment via Prolific (~200 participants) ✔

- data analysis ✔

- preliminary report ✔

### Conclusion
- Different groups manifest different compositions of behavioral modes (i.e., the relationship between confidence levels and performance).

- The difficult-medium-easy order significantly reduces participants’ confidence levels. 

- However, the order of task difficulty does not have a significant impact on overall performance.
