<p>In this part, </p>

<p><b>[Your tasks]</b> You will have to solve 15 tasks. <b>Each task comprises one <i>test question</i> and two <i>estimation
    questions</i></b>. In each task, the first estimation question asks you to estimate your confidence in the correctness of
    your own answer to the test question. The second estimation question asks you to estimate the average correctness rate
    of all participants. Additionally, in this part, after every 5 tasks, there is a fatigue measurement question.
    <span style="color: red;">Note: </span>for each <i>test question</i>, you have <b><span style="color: red;"> at most 2 minutes</span></b>
    to finish. Once the time is up, the test question will end <i>automatically</i>, and the answer will be submitted.</p>

<p><b>[Your earnings]</b> In case you are eligible for the bonus, at the end of the experiment, <b> one of the 15 tasks will
    be randomly selected</b> by computer and you will be paid according to your performance in this chosen task. This
    means that every answer is potentially relevant for your payment, so that you should think about each task carefully.
    Specifically,
<ul>
   <li>for the test question: you will receive <b>10 points</b> if you answer to the test question in the chosen task is <b>correct</b>.</li>
    <li>for the <i>first</i> estimation question: you will receive <b>up to 10 points</b> for your estimation and the closer
        your estimation is to the truth, the more points you can get. By <b>"closer to the truth"</b>, we mean:
        <ul>
            <li> the <i>lower</i> the confidence level you state when your answer to the test questions is <i>wrong</i>.<br>
            <li> the <i>higher</i> the confidence level you state when your answer to the test questions is <i>correct</i>.
        </ul></li>
</ul>
