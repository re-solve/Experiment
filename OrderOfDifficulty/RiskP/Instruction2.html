<div class="grey-border-box">
    <p>Imagine there is an <b>opaque</b> box containing <span class="blue-text">5 blue balls</span> and <span class="red-text">5 red balls</span>.</p>
    <p>At each decision point, you are required to choose between two options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Option A: Draw a ball from the box. If the drawn ball is <span class="blue-text">blue</span>, you receive <i>10</i> points</li>
        <li>Option B: Directly receive <i>X</i> points without drawing a ball</li>
    </ul>
    <p>where the value of <i>X</i> differs at each decision point. </p>
</div>

</body>
</html>

</ul>
    <p>There is no right or wrong choice, please make decisions based on your preferences. </p>

<p><b>[Your earnings]</b> In case you are eligible for the bonus, at the end of the experiment, <b>one of the 11 decision points
    will be randomly selected</b> by computer. If you select option A in the chosen decision point, then the computer will randomly
    draw a ball from the box; if it is a blue ball, you will get 10 points, if not, you will get 0 points. If you select option
    B in the chosen decision point, then you will directly get the corresponding <i>X</i> points.</p>
